I am building the famous casino game Blackjack. The simplified version of blackjack is you (the player) and the dealer are each dealt two cards to start. You will either chose to be dealt another card, or stay with your cards, with the goal of having a hand totaling 21, or closer to 21 than the dealer, without actually going over 21.
